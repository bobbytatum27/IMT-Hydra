    Bubble cam class which inherits from Cam
	
    Attributes
    ----------
    
    camera : EasyPySpin.VideoCapture

    gain : int
    brightness : int
    gamma : float
    fps : int

    image_type : String
    buffer_size : int
    buffer : Deque

    Methods
    -------
    
    power_on()
        creates a camera reference and stores it in the appropriate member variable
    power_off()
        a call to the camera reference's release() method; see cSBC.py
    write_data(file_handler?)
        write the data in the buffer to file
    collect_data()
        continuously log data in a double-ended queue.
    set_state(next_state: Enum {Quiescent, Storm, Event})
        changes the state of the cam to the passed parameter
    detect_event()
        triggers the Bubble Cam event response -> collects data and logs event time
